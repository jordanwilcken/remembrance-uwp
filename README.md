# remembrance
A little UWP application that taught me that I do not like UWP.  It was intended to be a port of [this web application that I made](https://github.com/jordanwilcken/remembrance), but porting to UWP was just too painful.

## How to Run
It's a UWP application, so I'm pretty sure you'll only be able to build and run this baby on Windows 10.  I developed it in Visual Studio 2017, and I dunno what UWP support is like on older Visual Studios.

## Why'd I build this Thing?/Why'd I abandon this Thing?
I like html, javascript, and C#, so why not bring them together to try something new?  Only it wasn't any fun.  There was way, way too much friction.  Unless you really want to target Windows Phone, I would steer clear of UWP - especially javascript for UWP.  In my experience, the .Net runtime provides for a much, much smoother development experience.
